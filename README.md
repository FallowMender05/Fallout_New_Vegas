Instructions & information

When creating a new BSA file, you can modify the Fallout.ini file to include extra BSA files for loading. However, you’ll need to make these changes through Mod Organizer 2 (MO2). MO2 provides a Fallout.ini editor that allows you to adjust file locations for loading the BSA. Remember to use this tool to avoid file reverts.
Remember, to always start the game using Mod Organizer 2. It’s best to keep this in mind as a personal note. If you’re looking for an easier modding experience, consider using Vortex, which integrates well with the Fallout local PC database. (Your Fallout new Vegas saved folder location).

If you encounter a missing Fallout.ini file, consider using Vortex. This tool can help resolve the issue by creating a custom Fallout.ini (Fallout-custom.ini) that allows you to continue on the modding process without too much hassle.

Understanding edits have consequences if done wrong.

To understand how folders are placed within the BSA, use a (BSA and BSA2) file viewer. This ensures that the game can locate images without encountering missing objects during gameplay. For example, the “Fallout-Texture.bsa” has two folders before reaching the main folder list. It’s advisable to maintain the original layout unless you’re experienced enough for advanced modding. (One Example) would require an artist to creat a .nif files inside an editor and making with setting file locations on 3D render(s), in the environment to present and display as they envisioned.

1. Fallout - Textures
2. textures
3. Please avoid restructuring the file format with renames, as doing so may disrupt its position within the other BSA files. As it could prevent the .DDS file from being read at all due to changes in the texture file mapping within the other .bsa folders as they depend on the file name locations.
4. Repackage the folders back into the .BSA format without making changes to the file name at all and remove or delete old .BSA…
