When working with DDS (DirectDraw Surface) files, understanding whether to save them in RGB format is essential. Let’s break it down:

DDS Format Overview:
A DDS file is a raster image saved in the DDS container format.
It’s commonly used for storing textures in games and graphics applications.
DDS files can store both compressed and uncompressed pixel formats.

RGB in DDS Files:
DDS files can represent colors using three 8-bit bands (Red, Green, Blue) or four 8-bit bands (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha).
Whether you need to save a DDS file in RGB depends on the context and purpose of the texture:

Diffuse Maps: If the DDS file serves as a diffuse map (the primary color texture), it should be saved in RGB.
Diffuse maps define the visible color information for surfaces, objects, and characters.
RGB channels control the overall color balance.

Other Maps: For other types of maps (e.g., normal maps, specular maps), consider their specific requirements.
Normal maps, for example, may use different channels (RGB or RGBA) based on the compression type.

Compression and Quality:
Compression affects both file size and visual quality.

When saving DDS files, consider the compression method:

DXT1: Used for textures without an alpha channel (interpreted as RGB).

DXT5: Supports RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) and is suitable for normal maps.
Uncompressed: For high-quality textures without lossy compression.
