DDS Format Overview:
A DDS file is a raster image commonly used for storing textures in games and graphics applications.
It can store both compressed and uncompressed pixel formats.
Think of it as a container for various texture data.

RGB in DDS Files:
RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue—the three primary colors used to create a wide range of colors.
In DDS files, colors are represented using these three 8-bit bands.
When you save a DDS file as an RGB texture, you’re essentially defining the visible color information for surfaces, objects, and characters.
Imagine it as the palette of colors that gives life to your digital world.

Normal Maps:
A normal map is a special type of texture used to simulate surface details without adding more polygons to a 3D model.
How does it work? Instead of directly altering the geometry of the model, a normal map stores information about surface normals.
Surface normals indicate the direction a surface faces at each point. They affect how light interacts with the surface.

In a normal map:
The red channel (X component) represents the surface’s tilt along the X-axis.
The green channel (Y component) represents the tilt along the Y-axis.
The blue channel (Z component) represents the tilt along the Z-axis.
When light hits a surface, the normal map helps create the illusion of bumps, dents, and fine details.
Imagine it as a magical spell that adds visual richness to your 3D world without increasing the model’s complexity.
